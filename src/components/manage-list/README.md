# Manage list

The manage list component uses a similar "add to a list" pattern found in other design systems, including:

- [Ministry of Justice
  Design System](https://design-patterns.service.justice.gov.uk/patterns/add-to-a-list/)
- [HM Revenue & Customs
  Design resources](https://design.tax.service.gov.uk/hmrc-design-patterns/add-to-a-list/)
- [Home Office User-Centred Design Manual](https://design.homeoffice.gov.uk/design-system/patterns/help-users-to/add-multiple-things)

Users are able to:
 - repeat a small journey to add multiple items into a list
 - change items in the list
 - remove items from the list
 - check their answers

The question view is the check-your-answers page, which by default shows a summary list. The summary list has the value for the item added, and action links for editing or removing the item.
